            <p>I think that the Madewell site has a very clean and crisp look to it. On this site we see that the 20%
                off
                coupons are in close proximity to eachother, but not too close as to avoid over crowding. The proximity
                of these elements unify the page while reducing clutter and conveying the main message. These ads are
                also
                in close proximity of the account login icon as well as the cart icon as to further push the reader to sign
                in or to sign up. </p>

            <p>
                I have always loved the aesthetic of American Eagles' page. It is not too overwhelming to the eye, and
                although their model photos take up the full width of the page, there is a beautiful amount of padding
                in between each image. I also think that there is a great amount of space in between the lines of the
                text,
                this way I dont feel like the words are almost bleeding together. All of these features work together
                hand
                in hand as to utilize the white space to create a clean, unified and crisp look while avoiding being over
                crowded.

            <p>
                Both the target app and the website overwhelm me just a tad bit as they do not really leave any whitespace
                on their site. In other words, there is just a lot going on! However, I will give props to the
                developers of this site, as I think they did a fantastic job incorporating enough contrast in between
                items so everything does not just bleed together. Through contrast, we see a clear distinction between
                different sale ads that are at the focus of their site.
