        <h2>Target Audience:</h2>

        <p>This site is targeted toward photographers, bloggers, influencer, and all the in betweens. One of the most
            common complaints that I hear amongst the social media community is never knowing when the BEST time to take
            their pictures is. This site will allow them to find their perfect window!</p>

        <h2>Personas:</h2>

        <p>Persona 1: Amanda is a photographer that specializes in natural light photography.

        </p>
        <p>Persona 2: Sarah is a social media influencer who frequently recieves time sensitive sponsered posts. </p>

        <h2> Scenarios:</h2>

        <p>Scenario 1: Amanda needs to find the window of the best lighting, temperature, and humidity for her clients
            session. Her client has informed her that she has 2 young kids that are very
            impatient, so she visits my site to plan everything out.</p>

        <p>Scenario 2: The weather where Sarah is can be considered very unpredictable, so she visits my site to figure
            out what day would be best to get the perfect picture for her post.
        </p>
